  about: "Hello! I’m Vansh Sharma, a Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science (AI/ML) at PES University. My journey in tech is driven by a desire to solve real-world problems through code. I have developed robust applications like NovaLearn, a full-stack educational platform, and a Hospital Queue Management System to optimize patient flow. My technical toolkit includes React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, supported by a strong foundation in C and Python. I believe in the power of community and collaboration. I actively contribute as a Technical Member for the AIML domain at Nexus (AWS Champ Club) and handle operations for the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors at PESU. My role as a Junior Manager at AIESEC has further sharpened my leadership and organizational skills, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical execution and operational success.",
